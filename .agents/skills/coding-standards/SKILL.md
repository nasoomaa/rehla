# Coding Standards

The canonical rules for all Rehla code, in one place, so a change to a
DataGrid, a payment class or a theme is held to the same bar as a change to a
package.

**Pint decides the mechanical questions.** Run `vendor/bin/pint` and trust it for
spacing, import order, trailing commas and the rest. What follows is what Pint
cannot see — and what a reviewer will otherwise send back.

## Reference files

| File | Load when |
|---|---|
| [code-style.md](code-style.md) | Writing any PHP — multi-clause conditions, class member order |
| [comments.md](comments.md) | Any comment or docblock, in any language |
| [laravel.md](laravel.md) | Framework idiom — events, migrations, config, helpers, validation, queues |
| [data-access.md](data-access.md) | Reading or writing the database — the repository rule and its one exception |
| [security.md](security.md) | Output, input, uploads, SQL, secrets, payments |
| [security-authorization.md](security-authorization.md) | Routes, permissions, guards, one user's access to another's data |
| [blade.md](blade.md) | Any `.blade.php` — namespaces, `:` versus `::`, components, page skeleton |
| [blade-formatting.md](blade-formatting.md) | Indentation, attribute layout, `@props` alignment, recipes |
| [localization.md](localization.md) | Any user-facing string, or a `Resources/lang/` change |

The PHP rules apply inside an `@php` block too, which Pint cannot reach.

## The rules in one screen

- **Every method and property carries a docblock**, whatever its visibility. The
  description is a capitalised sentence ending in a full stop. Type information
  belongs in the signature; add `@param`/`@return` only for what a native type
  cannot express.
- **Class members run constants → properties → constructor → public →
  protected → private**, each visibility one contiguous block. A helper called
  by a public method still lives in the protected block at the bottom.
- **A condition with more than one clause goes multiline**, the boolean operator
  leading each line. Single-clause conditions stay inline. The rule keys off the
  number of clauses, not the line length.
- **No comments inside method bodies**, object literals or markup — not even a
  one-line "why". A non-obvious reason belongs in the method's docblock or the
  commit message. If a line needs prose to be understood, extract a named
  method instead. See [comments.md](comments.md).
- **A class docblock defines what the class is.** It is not the history of what
  it replaced or why the previous approach was wrong.
- **All database access goes through a repository.** No `DB::` and no model
  queries in controllers, listeners, jobs or services. The single sanctioned
  exception is a DataGrid's `prepareQueryBuilder()`.
- **Events are dot-delimited strings**, not classes — `catalog.product.update.after`
  — and fire in `before`/`after` pairs. See [laravel.md](laravel.md).
- **`:` binds a PHP value, `::` passes a literal `:` through to Vue**, and `::`
  only works on a Blade component tag. Getting this wrong fails silently. See
  [blade.md](blade.md).
- **Authorize on the server and escape at the point of interpolation.** Hiding a
  control is presentation; the route and the controller decide what is allowed,
  and a value is safe in element text yet dangerous inside an attribute. See
  [security.md](security.md).
- **Scope every storefront query to its owner.** An id from the request never
  selects a row on its own — that is the easiest real vulnerability to introduce
  here. See [security-authorization.md](security-authorization.md).
- **Every user-facing string goes through `trans()`**, with the key added to
  all supported locales (`ar`, `en` in V1) under `Resources/lang/`.
- **Fix what you touch.** A pre-existing violation in a file you edit is yours —
  scan the whole class's member order and docblocks, not just your own lines.

## Where the code and these files disagree

The checkout wins. Follow the surrounding code, say so in your summary, and
raise the drift — these files are a snapshot, not the source of truth.

That is different from a file that is simply wrong: a missing docblock in an
untouched class is debt, not a convention. Match the *rule*, not the worst
example of it.
